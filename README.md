# Chocolatey Workshop - Internalizer

This is the material for the workshop "Setting up Internal Chocolatey Deployments" written by Gary Ewan Park and Paul Broadwith.

## Content

Software management and deployment is already a task, getting that good base of infrastructure in place right definitely helps. When you are using Chocolatey for software deployments, there are some recommendations on how to set up source control and testing infrastructure, not to mention how best to set up your production deployment infrastructure for success. Achieving reliability, repeatability, and scale is important in any organization - come let us show you how to easily achieve all of that.

In this workshop you will get hands on experience with:

- Setting up your workstation for Chocolatey packaging (best tools to use)
- Preparing Chocolatey for internal use
- Setting up a package repository (Chocolatey.Server)
- Setting up a CI system (Jenkins)
- Testing software deployments

This workshop would not have been possible without the amazing work of [Stefan Scherer](https://github.com/StefanScherer).  The contents of this workshop are based on the work that Stefan did in this [repository](https://github.com/StefanScherer/windows-docker-workshop), where he shows how to put together a full workshop environment using Packer, Terraform and Azure.
